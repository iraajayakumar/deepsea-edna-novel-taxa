# Unsupervised Discovery of Novel Taxa in Deep-Sea eDNA

This repository implements an unsupervised learning pipeline for discovering potential novel taxonomic groups from deep-sea environmental DNA (eDNA) samples.

The method is based on:
- Frequency Chaos Game Representations (FCGR)
- Self-supervised learning via mutual information maximization
- Clustering without reference databases

This project adapts and extends existing FCGR-based clustering methods to the unique challenges of deep-sea eDNA.
